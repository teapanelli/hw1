The numbers inside the parenthesis after a function can modify the x or y position, or the colors.  The "fill" lines 26 and 28 deal with color, while the numbers in the parenthesis for lines 10, 32, and 33 determine size and movement. 

The fill is the color inside the bubble, the stroke is the line around it.
